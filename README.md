X1 Ship Config Simulator

This is a ship configuration simulator for SpaceTraders, a space exploration and mining/trading game served over a REST API. Start with a frame, then swap engines/reactors and attach mounts and modules as you please while keeping an eye on the power/crew requirements of your selections. As SpaceTraders is still under development, these are hypothetical ship configurations until players can swap parts other than mounts.
